Requires:       mpv

%description
Riptide is a terminal-based music player for Tidal with a TUI interface built in
Rust (ratatui), driving mpv over its JSON IPC socket for playback.

%prep
%autosetup -n %{name}-%{version}

# Deliberately not cargo-rpm-macros. Its prep macro writes "net offline = true"
# unconditionally and repoints cargo at Fedora's local crate registry, which
# would require all 478 transitive dependencies to be packaged as crate() RPMs.
# This targets a COPR user repo instead, where "Enable internet access during
# builds" lets cargo fetch from crates.io against the committed Cargo.lock.
# Submitting to Fedora proper would need cargo vendor and a vendored tarball.

%install
# -s strips: with debug_package disabled rpm never strips the binary itself, and
# an unstripped Rust binary carries a symbol table several times its own size.

%changelog
* Wed Sep 09 2026 Fezzik the Giant <noreply@github.com> - 1.4.0-1
- Added: Self-update for binaries installed via install.sh or a manual release download.
- Added: Fullscreen album-art mode with Shift+A, on-demand high-resolution covers, and a compact playback HUD
- Added: The help modal filters as you type.
- Changed: j and k type into the help modal instead of scrolling it, now that it has a filter box of its own — the same rule the search box, the filter box and the command palette already followed.
- Fixed: The selected row was unreadable on light terminal themes.
- Fixed: The quality badge punched an eight-column hole through the middle of the highlighted row.
- Fixed: The library list and the queue could both draw a cursor at once, so neither looked like the pane the keys went to.
- Fixed: The queue's divider and title were a fixed dark grey, which on a light terminal read stronger than the focused accent and inverted the signal they exist to give.

* Wed Aug 19 2026 Fezzik the Giant <noreply@github.com> - 1.3.0-1
- Added: j and k move down and up in every list — the tabs, the detail views, the queue, the help modal and the pickers.
- Added: Volume, seek, shuffle and stop now work from desktop media widgets and playerctl, alongside the play/pause and skip controls that already did.
- Added: The now-playing bar reports the bit depth and sample rate Tidal actually delivered, next to the quality badge.
- Changed: The Home tab is a carousel.
- Changed: List rows are laid out in columns: title, artists, then duration, quality badge and favourite marker.
- Fixed: Tracks credited to more than one artist listed only the first.
- Fixed: Mix playlists showed "0 tracks".
- Fixed: The Search tab's playlist results showed no favourite marker, so saved and unsaved playlists looked identical
- Fixed: The command palette was unusable while the queue had focus: : opened it, but everything typed afterwards went to the queue, where c copied a link and d removed a track
- Fixed: Album art on the now-playing bar could vanish when a track without a cover started, and stayed gone for the rest of the queue.
- Fixed: Play from a stopped state could restart the current track instead of resuming it, if a media key repeated or a desktop sent the command twice
- Fixed: Sign-in failures now say what Tidal actually reported instead of only the HTTP status.
- Internal: Listing the Playlists tab no longer fetches every playlist's full track list to display their names — 320 KB and three quarters of a second became 26 KB.
- Internal: The tab strip shared by the artist, search and Home views is one helper rather than two copies, and every list row goes through one of four row builders instead of being assembled by hand in twelve places
- Internal: Truncation is measured in display columns rather than characters, so CJK titles and emoji no longer misalign the columns around them

* Tue Aug 18 2026 Fezzik the Giant <noreply@github.com> - 1.2.0-1
- Added: Press u to undo the last thing you removed from your library — a track, artist, album or playlist.
- Added: Dolby Atmos tracks and albums now show an ATMOS badge.
- Changed: Removing something from your library moved from f to d, matching what d already does in the queue.
- Internal: The identical quality-badge implementations on tracks and albums collapsed into one helper
- Internal: Dropped the audioQuality field from tracks and albums along with the MQA and 320 badges that read it.

* Tue Aug 18 2026 Fezzik the Giant <noreply@github.com> - 1.1.1-1
- Fixed: The Albums and Playlists tabs stopped at the first page, showing about 20 entries however large the library was.
- Fixed: A track that appeared twice in a row in the queue restarted from the beginning over and over, and the repeated stream requests eventually drew a "429 Too Many Requests" from Tidal.
- Fixed: Tracks that Tidal reports more than once in your favorites are now listed once.
- Internal: Logs are readable again.
- Internal: A failed AUR or COPR publish now fails the release run instead of being tolerated

* Mon Aug 17 2026 Fezzik the Giant <noreply@github.com> - 1.1.0-1
- Added: Filter the Tracks, Artists, Albums and Playlists tabs by pressing / and typing.
- Changed: The command palette moved from / to :, freeing / for filtering.
- Fixed: The Now Playing bar — title, album art, details and lyrics — could describe a different track than the one actually playing.
- Fixed: Pressing shuffle while a track was ending could hand playback to a different track, again leaving Now Playing behind.
- Fixed: Turning shuffle off discarded every track queued since it was turned on, and could leave the selection pointing at a different track than the one playing
- Fixed: Starting a new album or playlist while shuffle was on left the previous playlist still loading pages into the queue
- Internal: The app now tracks what mpv actually has queued and re-syncs when the two disagree, instead of assuming mpv followed along.
- Internal: Removing an item from a library list goes through one helper rather than three near-identical copies, and the blinking input cursor is defined once instead of in every text box

* Fri Aug 14 2026 Nicolás Rodríguez Álvarez <noreply@github.com> - 1.0.0-1
- Initial COPR packaging
